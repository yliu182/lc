297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the
same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no
restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Example 1:
    Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
    Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

Example 2:
    Input: root = []
    Output: []

Constraints:
    - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
    - -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
