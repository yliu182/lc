142. Linked List Cycle II

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If
there is no cycle, return None.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can
be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.

Do not modify the linked list.

Example 1:
    Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
    Output: tail connects to node index 1
    Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to
    the second node.

Example 2:
    Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
    Output: tail connects to node index 0
    Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to
    the first node.

Example 3:
    Input: head = [1], pos = -1
    Output: no cycle
    Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Constraints:
    The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].
    -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
    pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
