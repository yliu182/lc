11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines
drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the
container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Example 1:
    Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    Output: 49

Example 2:
    Input: height = [1,1]
    Output: 1
